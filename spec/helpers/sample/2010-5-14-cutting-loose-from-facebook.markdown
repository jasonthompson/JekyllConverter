I've wanted to delete my Facebook account for a long time, but I've always been too scared to go through with it. There's always that nagging fear that without Facebook, I'm going to miss out on something. But their terrible privacy record, most recently [with the implementation of Connections](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/05/things-you-need-know-about-facebook "Six Things You Need to Know About Facebook Connections"), has finaly forced my hand. Of course none of this is surprising. They've got to make money somehow. Indeed, these attempts to use your data to make money will only get more intrusive.

Aside from these privacy issues, I have never felt comfortable with the walled garden concept of social networking that Facebook represents. It seems strange to me that people so readily subscribe to this. What if all of your real world socializing had to take place in designated zones? Somehow I don't think people would like that much. I know I don't. So today I finaly got around to deleting my account. 

Henceforth, this blog will be the centre of my social media universe.
