Around the same time that [Don Cherry was making a mockery of democracy](http://torontoist.com/2010/12/don_cherrys_speech_to_council_transcribed.php "Transcript of Don Cherry's Speach") during Rob Ford's investiture at Toronto's City Hall, I read this great piece by [Matthew Cheney](http://mumpsimus.blogspot.com/ "Mumpsimus") at [Strange Horizons](http://www.strangehorizons.com/ "Strange Horizons") called the ["Failure of Masculinity"](http://www.strangehorizons.com/2010/20101011/cheney-c.shtml "Strange Horizons: Failure of Masculinity"). Then, the day after Don Cherry's infamous appearance in Toronto's City Hall, I came across  [this photo of Don Cherry, "Looking like a lady's handbag"](http://deadspin.com/5530094/don-cherry-looks-like-a-ladys-handbag "Don Cherry looks like a lady's handbag"), which prompted the following thoughts. Before continuing on, I strongly recommend that you take the time to read Cheney's piece.

      reader.title.should match(/Don Cherry/)
    end
